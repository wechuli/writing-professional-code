# Readable Code

## Introduction to Code Refactoring

Refactoring can be described as follows: "To reqrite existing source code in order to improve its readability, reusability or structure without affecting its meaning or behavior"

### Benefits of Refactoring

- **Reduce complexity** - the less complex, the easier it is to understand and maintain.
- **Make code more readable** - even if the code is naturally comlex, having code that is practically self-describing goes a long way toward helping you learn how it functions
- **Improve code maintainability** - if code is easy to maintain, both the developer maintaining the code and the user benefitting from fatser turnaround of bugs fixes and features, will be happy.
- **Make code easier to test** - we can drastically increase the quality of a codebase amd make future updates more predictable when tests are easy to add.
- **Improve code design** - a good design can give a codebase enough flexibility to allow for those moments when changes or features need to be added.
- **Make code easier to extend and reuse** - a developers job is made easier whenthey can understand the code, make changes with quality and predictability. Consuming code that has been well maintained is also a lot easier.

These are all desirable traits for any code base and make it cheaper to maintain over time. All changes to software come at a cost so being able to make changes that are of high quality and to do so in an efficient manner is a critical success factor.

## Consistency of Style

Coding style matters in aproject because it removes one more thing to worry about as you try to read and understand the code. You will need to tweak your code to aim at being more consistent in terms of positioning of brackets, spacing around comments and making sure we have only one statement per line. If you use a consisten style across large code bases, it will pay dividends and remove one more cognitive load for the person trying to read the code.
